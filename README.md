## Last comment :
This is the first comment and I created my files back in 2018 and I decided to put it here as a back up.

Plus the versionning will be pretty useful too.

I found some incoherences in my thought and must give a massive review on my files.

## Formats
* I did 2 folders ;
    * Matrix    :   Where usage will be mostly for Characters displaying.
    * Strip     :   Where usage will be coloring a room, for example.
